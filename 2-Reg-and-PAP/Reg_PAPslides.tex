Overview
\begin{itemize}
\item
Publication bias is a problem.

\item
Registration can help with publication bias.
\item
P-hacking/specification searching is a problem.
\item
Pre-analysis plans can help with specification searching.
\item
What should we include in our PAP, and where should we post it?
\end{itemize}

\section*{Publication Bias}
\begin{frame}{Publication Bias}%{Subtitles are optional.}
  % - A title should summarize the slide in an understandable fashion
  %   for anyone how does not follow everything on the slide itself.
  Existence of the problem:
  \begin{itemize}[<.->]
  \item
 Effect sizes diminish with sample size (Gerber, Green, Nickerson 2001)
  \item
  There is a higher fraction of rejected hypothesis tests in social compared to hard sciences (Fanelli 2010).
  \item
  	Published null results are disappearing over time, in all disciplines (Fanelli 2011). 
  \item
  	Data on the complete set of experiments run shows strong results are 40pp more likely to be published, and 60pp more likely to be written up. The file drawer problem is large. (Franco, Malhotra, Simonovits 2014)

\begin {frame}{Publication Bias}
If we only write up/publish significant results, and we have no record of all the insignificant results, we have no way to tell if our `significant' results are real, or if they're the 5\% we should expect due to noise.
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Registrations}
\begin{frame}{Registrations-Medicine}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item
   Publicly stating all research you will do, and what hypotheses you will test, prospectively.
   %\item If we know every hypothesis test that is run on a given subject, we have a better idea of how seriously to take the significant results.
  \item Store this statement in a public registry.
  \item
   Near universal adoption in medical RCTs. Top journals (\href{http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe048225}{ICMJE}) won't publish if it's not registered.
   \item Largest: \url{http://clinicaltrials.gov}
  \item
   Even better if registry requires registering outcomes after study. Currently limited, and poor compliance (\href{http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1409364}{Anderson et al. 2015}) but NIH is moving on this. \href{http://www.nih.gov/news/health/nov2014/od-19.htm}{\beamerbutton{Link}}

It is a free, easy-to-use database that makes access to trial results more transparent, aims to address the growing number of requests for registration by funders and referees, and helps solve the problem of publication bias by providing a single place where all trials are registered in advance of their start. As of May 31, 2015, the AEA Registry had a total of 379 registered controlled trials in 70 different countries. See how the registry continues to grow below.''

\section{P-Hacking}
\begin{frame}{P-Hacking}
\begin{itemize}
\item
Also called fishing, researcher degrees of freedom, data mining, data massaging, data dredging, or specification searching.
\item
Definition: flexibility in data analysis allows portrayal of \textit{anything} as below an arbitrary p-value threshhold; significance loses its meaning.
\item
Not something only evil people do. It can be subconcious---humans are really good at motivated reasoning.
\item
Not just that, we make completely reasonable but data-dependent decisions (Gelman, Loken 2013/2014 ``Garden of Forking Paths'')

\section{Pre-Analysis Plan}
\begin{frame}{Pre-Analysis Plan}
\pause
\begin{itemize}
\item
Often part of a registration
\item
From 3ie: ``A pre-analysis plan is a detailed description of the analysis to be conducted that is written in advance of seeing the data on impacts of the program being evaluated. It may specify hypotheses to be tested, variable construction, equations to be estimated, controls to be used, and other aspects of the analysis. A key function of the pre-analysis plan is to increase transparency in the research. By setting out the details in advance of what will be done and before knowing the results, the plan guards against data mining and specification searching. Researchers are encouraged to develop and upload such a plan with their study registration, but it is not required for registration.''

Reporting standards, but related.
\pause
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Authors must decide the rule for terminating data collection before
  data collection begins and report this rule in the article.
\item
  Authors must collect at least 20 observations per cell or else provide
  a compelling cost-of-data-collection justification. (Update: More!)
\item
  Authors must list all variables collected in a study.
\item
  Authors must report all experimental conditions, including failed
  manipulations.
\item
  If observations are eliminated, authors must also report what the
  statistical results are if those observations are included.
\item
  If an analysis includes a covariate, authors must report the
  statistical results of the analysis without the covariate.
\end{enumerate}
