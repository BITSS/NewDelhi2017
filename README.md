### Materials for the February 2017 Reproducibility Training , New Delhi India

## Installation Instructions
The workshop will introduce you to tools that can help you make your workflow more reproducible. You are required to install [the following software programs](http://www.bitss.org/2016/01/08/open-source-software-for-reproducible-social-science/)  before coming to the workshop for the hands-on exercises. (This takes a while, so please don't leave it to the last minute. It's OK if you run into difficulties; we'll be happy to help.


The numbered files/directories will take you through the workshop in order.

2-Reg-and-PAP is slides and activities on registration and pre-analysis plans.

3-Repro-Code is slides and activities on coding for reproducibility.

4-DataSharing-and-Rep is slides and activities on data de-identification, sharing, and replication.

5-VersionControl describes activities for using Git with the Github Desktop application and the Github website.
