Replication and Data Sharing Activities
============================
by Garret Christensen

There are several activities you can do to work on replication:

Conceptual Replication:

1. Read the major pyschology and economics replications papers in *Science*, the technical comment, and the reply. All are linked [here](http://datacolada.org/47). You may also find Brian Nosek and Elizabeth Gilbert's [blog description](http://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/07/lets-not-mischaracterize-replication-studies-authors/) of the differences between one specific original study and its replication interesting. What term from Michael Clemens' replication taxonomy do you think best applies to this research? Where do you come down as to whether the experiments were similar enough to be considered replications?

Empirical Replication:

1. You can download the data from the "crowdsourcing paper" ("Many analysts, one dataset: Making transparent how variations in analytical choices affect results" by Raphael Silberzahn and many others, including myself.) The data and materials are on [the OSF](https://osf.io/gvm2z/). You could either try and replicate (in the pure verification sense) my small contribution by using [my Stata code](https://osf.io/kx3q9/), or you could continue in the spirit of the project and see if you get different results by starting your own analysis from scratch.

2. R users can easily attempt to replicate a paper on the causes of the housing crisis: "[The Subprime Crisis: Is Government Housing Policy to Blame?](https://osf.io/h9rcu/)" by Avery and Brevoort. It might be interesting to see how easy it is for you to find the data and code on your own (Is it linked or even mentioned in the paper? Is there any way you would know it was available if I didn't tell you?) but if you want a direct link, go [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/28521).

3. Stata users can attempt to replicate Casey, Glennerster, and Miguel's "[Reshaping Institutions: Evidence on Aid Impacts Using a Preanalysis Plan](http://emiguel.econ.berkeley.edu/research/reshaping-institutions-evidence-on-aid-impacts-using-a-preanalysis-plan)". The data is [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=hdl%3A1902.1/21708).

For data sharing:

4. Once you've replicated a paper to your satisfaction, share what you've done by uploading your code to a repository. (Or at least going as far as creating a draft--repositories can be permanent and deliberately have no delete option, so you might not want to post a demo.) Try Harvard's [Dataverse](http://dataverse.harvard.edu), [OpenICPSR](http://OpenICPSR.org), [Dryad](http://datadryad.org), [Figshare](http://figshare.com), or search [re3data](http://re3data.org) to find the most appropriate place for your type of research. If you use Dataverse or Figshare, once you've posted data, create an OSF page for your replication and link that repository to the Open Science Framework.
